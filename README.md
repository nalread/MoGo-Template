# MoGo-Template
This is a learning project to accustom myself with cutting up .psd templates. All remarks are welcome (as long as they're constructive).

## Prerequisites
For further development you'll need:
  * Node.js - mostly for NPM, the package manager
  * SASS - for compiling stylesheets

### Packages used
For development I used:
  * Twitter Bootstrap
  * Grunt
  * grunt-browser-sync
  * grunt-sass
  * grunt-contrib-watch
  * grunt-contrib-imagemin (no functional use)
  
### Languages used
  * HTML
  * CSS (via SASS preprocessing)
  * Javascript (mostly on Bootstrap's side, but also used to set up Grunt)
